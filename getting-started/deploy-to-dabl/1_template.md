First off lets check that we are in the create-daml-app parent folder or our app

```
pwd
```{{execute T1}}

You should see `/root/create-daml-app` as the output.

Let's start by creating a `target` folder that will contain all the artifacts that we will deploy

```
mkdir -p target/
```{{execute T1}}
