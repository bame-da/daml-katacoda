Time to upload your artifacts to your new ledger!

First download the artifacts you built in the previous steps:

- [Download create-daml-app.dar](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/create-daml-app.dar)

- [Download create-daml-app-ui.zip](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/create-daml-app-ui.zip)

Then click on your newly created ledger and under the _"App Artifacts"_ tab click on _"Upload .dar"_ and upload the `create-daml-app.dar` you just downloaded.

You should see two confirmation messages and your `.dar` file will appear under the _"DAML Models"_ section.

For the last step you will need to upload your UI Assets.

Click on the _"Expand Section"_ to reveal the artifact tiles. Find the _"UI Assets"_ tile and click on it to upload the `create-daml-app-ui.zip` you just downloaded.

You should get another set of confirmations and the _"App UI"_ tile will activate revealing the subdomain of your deployed app and a quick link to visit it:

Click on _"View Site"_ or copy paste the subdomain link to a new browser tab and start interacting with your deployed app!
