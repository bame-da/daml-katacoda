In the previous scenario of this series, you learned how to build and run your first daml application. We do this through the example of a simple social networking application. The tutorials cover:

1. How to build and run the application ([Running the app](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/index.html#running-the-app)).
1. How to deploy your app to project:DABL (this tutorial).
1. The design of its different components ([Application Architecture](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/app-architecture.html)).
1. How to write a new feature for the app ([Your First Feature](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/first-feature.html)).

In this scenario we will learn how to deploy the social network app you previously built, to project:DABL. We will:

- Build our app artifacts and get them ready for deployment
- Create a DABL account (if this is your first time using DABL)
- Create a DABL Project and a Ledger that will host our app
- Download the artifacts that we will build here and deploy them to our newly created Ledger

Let's get to it!
